# Electronics Recycling and Refurbishment Tracking System

A comprehensive blockchain-based solution built on the Hedera network for tracking electronic devices throughout their entire lifecycle - from manufacturing to recycling and refurbishment. This system provides transparency, accountability, and compliance monitoring for the electronics recycling industry.

## Overview

This project consists of four interconnected smart contracts that work together to create a complete ecosystem for electronics lifecycle management:

- **Nexus** - Core device registry and lifecycle management
- **Verdant** - Recycling processes and environmental tracking
- **Phoenix** - Refurbishment and device restoration
- **Argus** - Compliance monitoring and audit oversight

## System Architecture

### Nexus Contract
The foundation of the system, Nexus manages:
- Device registration with unique identifiers
- Ownership transfers throughout the lifecycle
- Device state transitions (manufactured, in-use, collected, processing, refurbished, recycled, disposed)
- Metadata storage and certification tracking
- Manufacturer authorization and device authentication

### Verdant Contract
Handles all recycling-related operations:
- Collection point registration and management
- Recycling facility certification
- Material recovery tracking by type (precious metals, rare earth elements, plastics, etc.)
- Environmental impact calculations (CO2 savings, energy usage, waste reduction)
- Process stage monitoring from collection to completion

### Phoenix Contract
Manages the refurbishment workflow:
- Refurbishment center registration
- Quality assessments with detailed grading systems
- Component replacement and repair tracking
- Certification issuance with warranty periods
- Success rate monitoring for refurbishment centers

### Argus Contract
Provides compliance and audit capabilities:
- Regulatory framework compliance (WEEE, RoHS, REACH, ISO standards)
- Audit scheduling and completion tracking
- Violation reporting and resolution
- Regulatory authority management
- Compliance status monitoring across all entities

## Key Features

- Refurbishment centers for device restoration
- Regulatory authorities for compliance oversight
- Auditors for quality assurance

### Environmental Impact Monitoring
- Real-time tracking of recycled materials
- CO2 emissions savings calculations
- Energy consumption monitoring
- Waste reduction metrics
- Environmental compliance reporting

### Quality Assurance
- Detailed device assessments with scoring systems
- Component-level tracking for repairs and replacements
- Certification processes with warranty management
- Success rate monitoring for service providers

### Regulatory Compliance
- Support for major international frameworks
- Automated compliance status tracking
- Audit trail maintenance
- Violation reporting and resolution workflows

## Smart Contract Interactions

The contracts are designed to work together seamlessly:

1. **Nexus ↔ Verdant**: Device state updates during recycling processes
2. **Nexus ↔ Phoenix**: Device state management during refurbishment
3. **All Contracts ↔ Argus**: Compliance monitoring and audit oversight
4. **Cross-contract authorization**: Secure inter-contract communication

## Use Cases

### For Manufacturers
- Register new devices with comprehensive metadata
- Track devices throughout their lifecycle
- Demonstrate environmental responsibility
- Comply with extended producer responsibility regulations

### For Collection Points
- Register collection facilities
- Track collected device inventory
- Demonstrate collection volumes and impact
- Coordinate with recycling facilities

### For Recycling Facilities
- Process collected devices through various stages
- Track material recovery rates
- Report environmental impact metrics
- Maintain compliance with environmental standards

### For Refurbishment Centers
- Assess device condition and repairability
- Track component replacements and repairs
- Issue quality certifications
- Provide warranty management

### For Regulatory Bodies
- Monitor industry compliance across all participants
- Conduct audits and track findings
- Investigate violations and track resolutions
- Generate compliance reports

### For Consumers
- Verify device authenticity and history
- Check refurbishment certifications
- Find authorized collection points
- View environmental impact of their device disposal

## Contract Deployment Order

Deploy the contracts in the following sequence:

1. **Nexus** - Deploy first as the foundation contract
2. **Verdant** - Deploy with Nexus contract address
3. **Phoenix** - Deploy with Nexus contract address
4. **Argus** - Deploy with addresses of all three previous contracts

## Data Models

### Device Information
Each device contains comprehensive information including serial numbers, manufacturer details, warranty information, current ownership, lifecycle state, certifications, and custom metadata fields.

### Process Tracking
Both recycling and refurbishment processes are tracked with detailed stage progression, timestamps, resource consumption, and outcome metrics.

### Compliance Records
Organizations maintain compliance records for various regulatory frameworks with certification dates, expiry tracking, and document hash storage.

### Environmental Metrics
System-wide environmental impact tracking includes total devices processed, materials recovered, energy consumption, and CO2 savings.

## Security Features

- Role-based access control for different stakeholder types
- State transition validation to prevent invalid operations
- Authorization checks for cross-contract interactions
- Admin functions for system management and emergency controls
- Comprehensive event logging for audit trails

## Integration Capabilities

The system is designed to integrate with:
- External compliance databases
- Environmental impact calculators
- Quality management systems
- Supply chain management platforms
- Regulatory reporting systems
- IPFS for document storage

## Scalability Considerations

Built on Hedera's high-throughput network, the system can handle:
- Large-scale device registrations
- High-frequency state updates
- Complex multi-party transactions
- Real-time compliance monitoring
- Comprehensive audit trails
